        		<h2>LongaSearch (under construction)</h2>
				<p> 

				If we ask what a convenient search application should look like,
				we observe several conflicting desires.
				

				<br/>
					
				On the one hand, a personalized search can be useful. For example,
				if you are a computer vision specialist and your search includes an “encoder” you may mean something 
				like a deep learning auto encoder, and not the encoders implied by the video compression engineers. 
				Personalized searche can proceed through association with
				the user of a  kind of personalized profile reflecting his search preferences.  
				On the other hand, the user may want to avoid storing their personal preferences on search engine servers.
					
					
				<br/>						
					
				The user may sometimes want to perform a personalized search, as in the example above.
				And sometimes not, if he wants to search “as a new person” without being connected to his previous 
				search history, as Duck Duck Go does.
					
				<br/>	
					
				Longa's research application is an attempt to cope with these contradictory requirements.
				By analyzing the user's search history, we create a user-specific “deep profile” that allows 
				you to perform highly personalized searches. 
				The profile is encrypted, stored on the user's computer and not sent to the outside.
				On the other hand, the user can control the personalization level his search using a simple sliding panel.
					
				<br/>		
					
				Our deep profile is actually a small generative network associated with the user. 
				With a slight exaggeration, it can be considered as an assistant created and stored on the user's device, 
				so that the user fully controls the help.
